# Elytra Bombing Mod

## Setup

When flying:
- if you hold a tnt and a flint and steel in your main and off hands
  - Right-clicking will use the flint and steel and summon a primed tnt with the velocity of the player * 1.2
- if you hold just an anvil and no item in your other hand
  - Right-clicking will summon an anvil falling block with the velocity of the player * 1.2

## Idea

I've actually had this idea ever since elytras were first released back in 2016. I remember commenting in a cubfan135 video about it and he actually read and replied to my comment, though I don't recall which video anymore.

In case someone finds it suspicious that my Elytra Bombing mod is not the first one to be made:
- I do not know and did not know about [Nova-Commitee](https://github.com/Nova-Committee/Elytra-Bombing) / MikhailTapio's Elytra Bombing mod on Curseforge.
- I do not know them nor did I see or copy any of their code.
- I came up with the idea for both dropping TNT and anvils in the same comment.

I'd say this is quite the coincidence, and I love that.
