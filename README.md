# Elytra Bombing Mod

## Setup

When flying:
- if you hold a tnt and a flint and steel in your main and off hands
  - Right-clicking will use the flint and steel and summon a primed tnt with the velocity of the player * 1.2
- if you hold just an anvil and no item in your other hand
  - Right-clicking will summon an anvil falling block with the velocity of the player * 1.2

## Idea

I've actually had this idea ever since elytras were first released back in 2016. I remember commenting in a cubfan135 video about it and he actually read and replied to my comment, though I don't recall which video anymore.
